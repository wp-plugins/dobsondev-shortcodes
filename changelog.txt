I've decided on an updating scheme that this plugin will now follow. Any change in a #.#.1 increment will denote minor bug fixes. Any change in a #.1.# increment will represent a new shortcode added to the plugin. Finally any change in 1.#.# will donate either a major shortcode being added or this could also go up if enough smaller shortcodes are added to the plugin.

From now on Bug Fixes will all fall under #.# Changlog. However, in brackets will show the exact version number where the bug was fixed. You can see an example below under the "Bug Fixes" heading where some bug fixes are noted as being fixed in the 1.0.1 patch.
