Add a collection of helpful shortcodes to your site.

== Description ==

A collection of helpful shortcodes that I use in my own work that I wanted to share with the WordPress Community. If you want to suggest any shortcodes please email me at [alex@dobsondev.com](mailto:alex@dobsondev.com).

= Shortcodes Included =

* Embed PDFs - Embeds PDFs into pages rather than separate links.
* Embed [GitHub Gists](http://gist.github.com/) - Easily add GitHub gists to your site or blog.
* Embed [Twitch Stream](http://twitch.tv/) - Embeds a Twitch Stream into the page.
* Embed [Twitch Stream](http://twitch.tv/) Chat - Embeds the chat from a Twitch Stream into the page.
* Embed [YouTube Video](http://youtube.com/) - Embeds a YouTube Video into the page.

**Embed PDF**

[embedPDF source="http://yoursite.com/path-to-the-pdf.pdf" width="###" height="###"]

This Shortcode will embed a PDF into the page rather than making it a seperate link that must be clicked to be viewed. It is displayed in the browsers default PDF reader since it is embedded as an application. The source attribute is the URL of the PDF and is required. The width and height attribute will set the size of the embedded application, and are both optional. If they are not entered then the width is set to 100% and the height to 600.

**Embed GitHub Gists**

[embedGist source="http://gist.github.com/your-account/gist-id"]

This Shortcode will embed a GitHub Gist into the page. The Gist will be embedded in a little box that makes it easy to share code samples with other developers (or whoever you want to share them with). The source attribute is the URL to the Gist and is required.

**Embed Twitch Stream**

[embedTwitch username="your-username" width="###" height="###"]

This Shortcode will embed a Twitch stream into the page. The username attribute is the Twitch Stream's username, which can be found at the end of the URL of the stream. An example would be [http://twitch.tv/day9tv](http://twitch.tv/day9tv). The username for this stream is "day9tv", so that would be entered. The username is a required attribute. The width and height attributes will set the size of the embedded stream, and both are optional attributes. If they are not entered the width will default to 620 and the height will default to 378.

**Embed Twitch Stream Chat**

[embedTwitchChat username="your-username" width="###" height="###"]

This Shortcode will embed a Twitch stream's chat into the page. The username attribute is the Twitch Stream's username, which can be found at the end of the URL of the stream. An example would be [http://twitch.tv/day9tv](http://twitch.tv/day9tv). The username for this stream is "day9tv", so that would be entered. The username is a required attribute. The width and height attributes will set the size of the embedded chat, and both are optional attributes. If they are not entered the width will default to 350 and the height will default to 500.

**Embed YouTube Video**

[embedYouTube video="video-id" width="###" height="###"\]

This Shortcode will embed a YouTube video into the page. The video attribute is the YouTube video ID of the video you want to embed into the page. It can be found at the end of the URL on YouTube. For example, the video located at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCdfze1etec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCdfze1etec) has the video ID "uCdfze1etec". You will always find the video ID after the "watch?v=". The video attribute is required. The width and height attributes will set the size of the embedded video, and both are optional attributes. If they are not entered the width will default to 560 and the height will default to 315.
