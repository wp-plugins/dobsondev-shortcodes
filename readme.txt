== Description ==

A collection of helpful shortcodes that I use in my own work that I wanted to share with the WordPress Community. If you want to suggest any shortcodes please email me at [alex@dobsondev.com](mailto:alex@dobsondev.com).

== Shortcodes Included ==

* [GitHub Gists](http://gist.github.com/) - Easily add GitHub gists to your site or blog.
* Embed PDFs - Embed PDFs into pages rather than separate links.
